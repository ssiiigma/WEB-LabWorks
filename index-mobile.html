        <h3>How books are transformative</h3>
        <p>As Carl Sagan noted, one glance at a book can transport you into the mind of
            another person, allowing you to see the world through their eyes.
            By stepping into
            the shoes of different characters, you can better understand human emotions and actions.</p>
